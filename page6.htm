<h2>I see...</h2>

<p>It seems your like me. One who has experienced the feeling of not being themself. Finding comfort in cold water on the face and jogging to keep my peaceful state.</p>

<p>The photos after this page are photos that either I have taken, or have complied from elsewhere that I feel show what<br>
dissociation is like visually and aesthetically for me. Please enjoy.</p>
