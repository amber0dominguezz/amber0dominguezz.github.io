<h2>I see...</h2>

<p>It seems your like me I guess! I suffer from dissociation pretty often and its always out of my control.<br>
Though it has been getting better recently and I wanted to try and embrace it in my work!</p>

<p>The photos after this page are photos that either I have taken, or have complied from elsewhere that I feel show what<br>
dissociation is like visually and aesthetically for me. Please enjoy!</p>
