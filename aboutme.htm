  <h1>About me and my art</h1>
  <p>Growing up, expression of my feelings and art was always embraced. I was the only creatively gifted in my family and was pushed to continue using the natural skills that I had. I went through many rough patches of art blocks and being discouraged of my abilities. I am currently in college now majoring in Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. I hope to explore my abilities now with my new found confidence and also share my work with others to inspire and collaborate.</p>
